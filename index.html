                According to tanzaniainvest.com, a website that shows how different sectors of the economy of Tanzania have been performing over the years, the Tanzanian tourism sector generated USD 1.4 billion in 2021 with 922,692 tourists visiting Tanzania in 2021.
                This makes the country's tourism sector a very profitable sector that would yield high returns on investments to any prospective investor.

            <h2>Which countries did their nationalities bring in the highest amount of revenue</h2>
            <p>
                Let's take a hypothetical situation where an investor would like to invest in Tanzania's tourism sector after learning about its great contribution to the economy. Which nationalities would he or she target in a marketing campaign using his or her 
                limited resources and have high returns on investment? Which nationalities are willing to spend a lot of money on tourism?
            </p>

            <h3>Why was the highest amount of money spent?</h3>
            <p>
                Let us take another hypothetical scenario where an investor would like to know what specific reason for a visit 
                by a tourist would generate high returns on their investment. This would help them decide on what product to sell or market.
            </p>

            <h4>Which age group of tourists brought the highest amount of revenue?</h4>
            <p>
                Which age group of individuals would generate the highest amount of income for their investment in the tourism sector in Tanzania? This would enable them to find out which age group of tourists to target in a marketing campaign or which products to 
                create that suit them. Is it the young, middle-aged, or old tourists?
            </p>
