            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>What should I do to invest in Tanzania's tourism sector for maximum returns?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to tanzaniainvest.com a website that shows how different sectors of the 
                    economy of Tanzania have been performing over the years the Tanzanian tourism 
                    sector generated USD 1.4 billion in 2021 with 922,692 tourists visiting 
                    Tanzania in 2021.  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Which countries did their nationalities bring in the 
                    highest amount of revenue?</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's take a hypothetical situation where an investor would like to invest in Tanzania's tourism sector after learning about its great contribution 
                    to the economy. Which nationalities would he or she target in a marketing
                     campaign using his or her limited resources and have high returns on 
                     investment?? Which nationalities are willing to spend a 
                     lot of money on tourism?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Why was the highest amount of money spent?</h2>
                <p>
                    Let us take another hypothetical scenario where an investor would like to know what specific reason for a visit by a tourist would generate high 
                    returns on their investment. This would help them to decide on what 
                    product to sell or market.  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Which age group of tourists brought the highest amount of revenue?</h2>
                <p>
                    Which age group of individuals would generate the highest amount of income for their investment in the tourism sector in Tanzania? This would enable
                    them to find out which age group of tourists to target in a marketing 
                    campaign or which products to create that suit them. Is it the young, 
                    middle-aged, or old tourists?? 
                </p>
